How to Contribute:

Those wishing to contribute to CityPulse can do so in three main ways:
Add more data knobs to Seattle - different pedestrians want different things from their city. If you know of a good dataset, see the “Creating Your Own Cleaner” section <link> to add a cleaner.
Add data knobs for new cities - CityPulse is looking to expand beyond Seattle. In order to do that, we need developers to add cleaners based on live, local city data. See the “Creating Your Own Cleaner” section <link> to add a cleaner.
