# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CityPulse! You can do so in three main ways:

1. **Add more data knobs to Seattle.** Different pedestrians want different things from their city. If you know of a good dataset, see the [Create your own cleaner](create-your-own-cleaner.md) to get started.
2. **Add data knobs for new cities.** CityPulse is looking to expand beyond Seattle. In order to do that, we need developers to add cleaners based on live, local city data. See the [Create your own cleaner](create-your-own-cleaner.md) to get started.
3. **Fix bugs!** We have an always growing list of bugs to be tackled. If you come across an issue, feel free to fork CityPulse and send us a pull request!
