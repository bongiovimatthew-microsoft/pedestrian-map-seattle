# Current Data Knob Definitions:

Below is a list of existing data knobs and their meanings.

## Pedestrian Safety
Routes that look for **Pedestrian Safety** will look to avoid areas where vehicle-pedestrian collisions occur. This data should be based on 911 reports of vehicle-pedestrian collisions or near-collisions. This feature in no way guarantees pedestrian safety, but it attempts to steer clear of high-risk areas. Â 

## Accessibility
Routes that look for **Accessibility** will seek routes with the following characteristics:
* Sidewalk ramps at street corners
* Blind talk-boxes at street crossings
* Low sidewalk slope (less steep route)
* Sidewalk quality (few cracks, holes, etc.)
This data should be based on city-provided locations of ramps, talkboxes, and street steepness. The sidewalk quality should be based on city-provided sidewalk auditing data, and/or user-provided sidewalk quality data.

## Nature
Routes that look for **Nature** will seek routes that are near parks, trees, flowers, and water. This data should be based on public park, tree, and floral location data, and can also include user-provided data.

## Clean Air
Routes that look for **Clean Air** will seek routes that have the least amount of air pollution (ozone). This data should be based on live ozone data from city sensors.

## Low Allergy
Routes that look for **Low Allergy** will seek routes that have the lowest pollen count. This data should be based on live pollen data from city sensors.

## Pet-Friendliness
Routes that look for **Pet Friendliness** will seek routes that are near parks, trees, flowers, water, and dog amenities (dog parks and dog waste dumps, for example). This data should be based on public park, tree, and floral location data, and can also include user-provided data (such as water bowls for dogs, etc.).

## Public Toilets
Routes that look for **Public Toilets** will seek routes that are near public toilets. This data should be based on city public toilet locations, and can also include user-provided data on the quality of public toilets.
