How CityPulse Works: 

CityPulse uses live data, provided by your city, to generate walking routes. CityPulse presents a user with a set of “data knobs”, which each correspond to one or more data sources. A data knob is a feature which the user seeks in their walking route, for example, “clean air” or “pet friendliness”. For a full list of existing data knobs, see the “Current Data Knob Definitions” section <link>.  

Users select data knobs for their route, and then sets a priority of the set they have chosen. This data is then used to determine how best to get the user from point A to point B, while maximizing their exposure to the data features they chose.
