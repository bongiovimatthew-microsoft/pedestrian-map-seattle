Data Review Process for New Cleaners:

When you send us a pull request containing new data cleaners, we will perform the following review, in which we will ask you to provide a small amount of testing and documentation.

Code review - a standard review of the changes you are making
Cleaner definition - If you are creating a new data knob (as opposed to implementing an existing knob in a new city), you must provide a definition of the data knob, to allow us to generate graphics and information bubbles for the user.
Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements - We will review the SLA of the data source which your cleaner leverages. We currently require a 99.9 % SLA.    
Timing requirements - A query sent to your cleaner for a bounding box of 300,000 square meters must take no more than 2 seconds to complete.
API key re-registration - we will register for our own API key for any data source you utilize, and will update the review with our key.
